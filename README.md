# PCA for Customer Credit Card Data Analysis

This repository provides a Python implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for analyzing customer credit card data.

## Purpose:

* Reduces the dimensionality of credit card data while retaining essential information.
* Identifies the principal components that explain the most variance in the data.
* Provides a foundation for understanding dimensionality reduction in financial data analysis.

## Implementation:

* Uses Python's `scikit-learn` library to implement PCA.
* Allows for selection of the number of principal components.
* Provides functionality for visualizing the explained variance and principal components.
* Implements methods for transforming and inverse-transforming data using PCA.

## Usage:

1.  Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2.  Input your credit card dataset (features).
3.  Run the provided Python script (`credit_card_pca.py`).
4.  Specify the desired number of principal components.
5.  Interpret output:
    * The script outputs the explained variance ratio for each principal component.
    * Visualizations of the explained variance are generated.
    * Transformed data is available for further analysis.

## Key Concepts:

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A dimensionality reduction technique.
* **Principal Components:** Linear combinations of the original features that capture the most variance.
* **Explained Variance:** The amount of variance in the data explained by each principal component.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information.
* **Feature Transformation:** Transforming the original features into a new set of features (principal components).

## Output:

* Explained variance ratio for each principal component.
* Visualizations of explained variance.
* Transformed credit card data.
* Information about the parameters used (number of components).
